In the era of digital communication, Twitter serves as a rich source of unfiltered user-generated content. 
Our text mining project, rooted in the Sentiment140 dataset comprising 1.6 million tweets, initially 
navigated the unstructured terrain of tweets without specific domains. As researchers, our objective was to 
analyze and understand the general sentiments prevalent in this vast dataset.

Driven by a commitment to contribute to mental health awareness, our focus shifted to a targeted 
investigation within the Mental Health dataset. This subset became the subject of our analysis, utilizing 
topic modeling techniques to identify prevalent themes and subjects within the discourse surrounding 
mental health on Twitter.

Our primary aim, beyond academic exploration, was to apply sentiment analysis models to discern 
emotional tones within specific mental health topics. This approach aimed to provide actionable insights, 
ranging from facilitating awareness campaigns to connecting individuals facing similar challenges. The 
intended impact transcended the analytical realm, seeking to bridge the digital gap for those seeking support 
or information related to mental health concerns.

This report chronicles our methodological journey, emphasizing the practical implications of sentiment 
analysis within the context of mental health discussions on Twitter. The goal is to present a comprehensive 
understanding of our findings and contribute valuable insights to the ongoing discourse surrounding mental 
health awareness in the digital age
